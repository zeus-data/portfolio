I will be using `OpenCV`'s implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images.
             OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on github. 
            I have downloaded one of these detectors to use.

How the code works: Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images
             to grayscale. The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in face_cascade and takes
             the grayscale image as a parameter.

In the code below, faces is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.
             Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected
             face. The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as x and y) specify the
             horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.
             The last two entries in the array (extracted here as w and h) specify the width and height of
             the box.

When using TensorFlow as backend, Keras CNNs require a 4D array (which we'll also refer to as a 4D tensor)
          as input, with shape (**nb_samples**, **rows**, **columns**, **channels**), where `nb_samples`
          corresponds to the total number of images (or samples),
          and `rows`, `columns`, and `channels` correspond to the number of rows,
          columns, and channels for each image, respectively.  

The `path_to_tensor` function below takes a string-valued file path to a color image as input and
          returns a 4D tensor suitable for supplying to a Keras CNN.  The function first loads the
          image and resizes it to a square image that is **224 times 224** pixels.  Next, the image is
          converted to an array, which is then resized to a 4D tensor.  In this case, since we are working
          with color images, each image has three channels.  Likewise, since we are processing a single image
          (or sample), the returned tensor will always have shape (**1, 224, 224, 3**).

The `paths_to_tensor` function takes a numpy array of string-valued image paths as input and 
         returns a 4D tensor with shape (`nb_samples`, 224, 224, 3).

Here, `nb_samples` is the number of samples, or number of images, in the supplied array of image paths. 
          It is best to think of `nb_samples` as the number of 3D tensors (where each 3D tensor corresponds
          to a different image) in the dataset!''')

st.write('''#### Making Predictions with ResNet-50

Getting the 4D tensor ready for ResNet-50, and for any other pre-trained model in Keras,
          requires some additional processing.  First, the RGB image is converted to BGR
          by reordering the channels.
           All pre-trained models have the additional normalization step that the mean pixel
          (expressed in RGB as [103.939, 116.779, 123.68] and calculated from all pixels in
          all images in ImageNet) must be subtracted from every pixel in each image. 
          This is implemented in the imported function `preprocess_input`. 
         
Now that there is a way to format the image for supplying to ResNet-50,
          the model is ready to extract the predictions. 
          This is accomplished with the `predict` method, which returns 
         an array whose $i$-th entry is the model's predicted probability
          that the image belongs to the $i$-th ImageNet category.
           This is implemented in the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function.

By taking the argmax of the predicted probability vector, the result is an integer
          corresponding to the model's predicted object class, which can be identified
          with an object category through the use of this

          to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained ResNet-50 model,

After implementing functions to detect humans and dogs in images

Initially, I will create a CNN from scratch, without transfer learning, and aim to achieve a minimum test accuracy of 1%. In subsequent steps, transfer learning will be applied to develop a more advanced
          CNN with significantly higher accuracy.

It‚Äôs important to recognize that adding multiple trainable 
         layers to the CNN increases the number of parameters,
          which can significantly extend training time. As a result,
          using a GPU is essential for speeding up the process. Fortunately,
          Keras provides an estimate of how long each epoch will take during training.
          Furthermore, identifying dog breeds from images is an inherently complex task.

- The CNN model has three convolutional layers and the network is capable of learning
          increasingly complex and abstract features as it progresses through these layers.
          These layers are responsible for extracting local features from the input images.
          They use filters to capture patterns, edges, and textures.

- A max pooling layer follows each convolutional layer. This layer reduces the spatial
          dimensions of the learned features by retaining the maximum value in each local
          region. This downsampling helps to decrease the computational load.

- Following the layers above, the global average pooling layer computes the average value
          of each feature map across its entire spatial dimensions. This results in a single
          value for each feature map, effectively summarizing the presence of each learned
          feature.

- The dense layer at the end connects every neuron from the previous layer to every neuron
          in its layer. This layer aggregates and combines these learned features from different
          spatial locations. The output of the dense layer is then fed into a softmax activation
          function, providing probability scores for different classes.



Convolutional Neural Networks are useful for image classification due to their specialized 
         architecture that takes into account the spatial relationships and hierarchical features
          present in images.  CNNs use convolutional layers to scan small area of an image at
          a time. This allows them to capture local features such as edges and patterns. 

They consist of multiple layers, each responsible for learning different levels of abstraction.
          This enables to understand and recognize intricate patterns in the data. Also, CNNs
          benefit from their pooling layer ability; they retain the most important information 
         in a local region with the ultimate goal of improved generalization. Finally, CNNs use
          backpropagation and gradient descent during training to update the
          weights and biases, optimizing the network for accurate classification. ''')

#### Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

I will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images.
           The new CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set.

In Step 4, I used transfer learning to create a CNN using VGG-16 bottleneck features.
           In this section, I will use the bottleneck
          features from a different pre-trained model. 
          To make things easier for you,
          we have pre-computed the features for all of the networks
          that are currently available in Keras.
           These are already in the workspace, at /data/bottleneck_features. 
          If you wish to download them on a different machine, they can be found at:
- [VGG-19](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG19Data.npz) bottleneck features
- [ResNet-50](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz) bottleneck features
- [Inception](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogInceptionV3Data.npz) bottleneck features
- [Xception](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogXceptionData.npz) bottleneck features

The files are encoded as such:

    Dog{network}Data.npz
    
where `{network}`, in the above filename, can be one of `VGG19`, `Resnet50`, `InceptionV3`, or `Xception`.  

The above architectures are downloaded and stored for you in the `/data/bottleneck_features/` folder.

This means the following will be in the `/data/bottleneck_features/` folder:

`DogVGG19Data.npz`
`DogResnet50Data.npz`
`DogInceptionV3Data.npz`
`DogXceptionData.npz`



### (IMPLEMENTATION) Obtain Bottleneck Features

    train_{network} = bottleneck_features['train']
    valid_{network} = bottleneck_features['valid']

Write a function that takes an image path as input and returns the dog breed (`Affenpinscher`,

Similar to the analogous function in Step 5, your function should have three steps:
1. Extract the bottleneck features corresponding to the chosen CNN model.
2. Supply the bottleneck features as input to the model to return the predicted vector.
          Note that the argmax of this prediction vector gives the index of the predicted dog
          breed.
3. Use the `dog_names` array defined in Step 0 of this notebook to return the corresponding
          breed.

The functions to extract the bottleneck features can be found in
          `extract_bottleneck_features.py`, and they have been imported in an earlier code cell.
           To obtain the bottleneck features corresponding to your chosen CNN architecture,
