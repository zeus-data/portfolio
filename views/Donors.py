st.write('''## Getting Started

In this project, I employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data.
          I will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.
          The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
          This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income 
         can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.
           While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, I can
          infer this value from other publically available features. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).''')

*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than
          50,000 USD are most likely to donate to their charity.

         50,000 USD accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating 
         a particular model's performace would be appropriate.
         Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than 50,000 USD as someone
          who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals
          willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict (**precision**)
          those that make more than 50,000 USD is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** 
         those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as

* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? 
        

The purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.
          In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model
          or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. 
         When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.



* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total.

st.write('''**My picks:**
         

#### 1.**AdaBoost Classifier:**


 **Advantages**: 

1. Its ease of use stems from minimal hyperparameter tuning requirements. Unlike many other algorithms, it requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, making it user-friendly.

2. AdaBoost demonstrates reduced vulnerability to overfitting. It displays a lower tendency to overfitting, enhancing its robustness in model training.

**Disadvantages**:

1. AdaBoost's susceptibility to noisy data and outliers means that the presence of outliers can notably influence the algorithm's performance, as these data points may receive substantial weight in the training process.

2.  The process of training an AdaBoost model can be computationally demanding, requiring significant computing resources.

3. AdaBoost is primarily tailored for addressing linear classification problems. In cases where the data exhibits intricate, non-linear relationships, AdaBoost may not perform as effectively as other algorithms specialized in capturing such non-linear patterns.

**A good candidate for the problem:**
AdaBoost is good to use for this kind of problem, because it can utilize other good classification algorithms, like  decision trees, to build the weak learners and deliver good results. 


#### 2.**Decision Tree Classifier:**
         
**Advantages**:
1. The primary benefit of decision trees is their exceptional ability to interpret and visually represent non-linear data patterns with ease.
2. Furthermore, they exhibit high speed, particularly during exploratory data analysis.
3. Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.

**Disadvantages**: 
1. They are prone to overfitting, especially when they are deep and highly complex.

2. A slight variation can lead to significantly different tree structures, making them less robust.

3. Greedy nature: Decision trees use a greedy algorithm that makes splits based on the best feature at each node. This can lead to suboptimal splits further down the tree. 

4. Complexity:  decision trees can become complex and hard to interpret for large datasets or deep trees.

**A good candidate for the problem**: This problem is a categorical one, and a decision tree should work well. 
         A decision tree classifier can assist us in pinpointing the most influential factor and a decision path that we can examine for a 
         given set of variables to determine whether an individual's income exceeds 50,000 USD. The model evaluates the information gain of 
         each split within the dataset, allowing us to efficiently identify the variables that play a pivotal role in determining whether a 
         person earns more than 50,000 USD and those that conclusively indicate otherwise.


#### 3.**Logistic Regression:**

**Advantages**:
1. Easy to implement and interpret yet efficient in training. Performs well on low-dimensional data.
2. Performs well on low-dimensional data.


**Disadvantages**: 
Logistic regression has limitations when dealing with non-linear problems.

**A good candidate for the problem:**
This type of statistical model  is often used for classification and predictive analytics. ''')

st.write('''
I select the AdaBoostClassifier as the top-performing model among the three options for the classification task of distinguishing individuals with incomes exceeding 50,000 USD.

`Accuracy`: Examining the bottom-middle plot, the AdaBoost Classifier achieved the highest accuracy score, surpassing 80\%, which was notably
          superior to both the Logistic Regression and the Decision Tree Classifier. Additionally, the AdaBoost Classifier maintained a
          superior accuracy score when using either 1\% or 10\% of the testing set. It's worth noting that, although the Decision Tree
          Classifier achieved the highest accuracy on training sets of all sizes, it exhibited a significantly lower accuracy score, indicating potential overfitting.

`F-score`: Most importantly, the AdaBoost algorithm delivered the highest F-score of approximately 70\% on the test dataset,
          consistently outperforming the other two models across all three dataset sizes. The bottom-right plot illustrates
          the AdaBoostClassifier (highlighted in red) achieving the highest F-score on 1\%, 10\%, or 100\% of the test dataset.

While the AdaBoost Classifier required slightly more time than the other two models for both training and prediction,
          the absolute time costs were minimal: less than 2 seconds for training and less than 1/10 of a second for prediction. 
         Ultimately, the AdaBoost Classifier emerged as the most accurate and precise model among the three options.

By using GridSearchCV, I optimised the AdaBoost algorithm by testing different number of learners created.

          when AdaBoost achieved its best performance by looking at the accuracy score and the F-score. 
The optimised model achieved {accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions):.1%}  ( against {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions):.1%} ) accuracy score
 and an F-score {fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5):.1%} vs the unoptimized model's {fbeta_score(y_test, predictions, beta = 0.5):.1%}.

As a reminder, the naive predictor's accuracy score was {accuracy:.2%} and its F-score was {fscore:.2%}, thus there is a huge improvement when using the AdaBoost algorithm.

st.write(f'''**Answer:**
The final model experienced a slight decrease in accuracy
          ({acc_red-acc_full:.2%}) compared to the original model, which utilized
          all available features. This decline in accuracy is relatively minimal.
          Similarly, the final model demonstrated a decrease of {f_red-f_full:.2%} in its F-score.
          Consequently, the model that utilized only five selected features exhibited both
          a slightly reduced accuracy and F-score. Evaluating the results
         , particularly when considering the potential cost of training time, it becomes
          worthwhile to seriously contemplate deploying the reduced-feature model given the 
         modest impact on accuracy and F-score.''')
